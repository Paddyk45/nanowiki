# nanowiki
A very small(~2MB) and minimalistic wiki/blog!

# Setup
0. Open src/main.rs in a text editor
1. Set the instance name - change INSTANCE_NAME to the name you wish
2. Set the password - change EDIT_PASSWORD to a somewhat secure password. If this is a private wiki, you can set it to "" to disable password-restricted editing
